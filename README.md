Phospholipids keep the membrane stable because one end is polar and the other is non-polar. The polar heads want to be on the outside of the membrane because they want to be near the water. The nonpolar tails want to be facing inward because they want to be away from water. Cholesterol can also stabilize the membrane because it can become esterified with fatty acids where the OH group is located. This makes the end with the fatty acids polar and stabilizes the membrane.
